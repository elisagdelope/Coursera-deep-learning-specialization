# Coursera-deep-learning-specialization

Here I provide the complete suite of material (notebooks) utilized during the Deep learning specialization on coursera, which I attended early 2020.

The Deep learning specialization on coursera consists on a series of 5 courses: 
- Neural Networks and deep learning 
- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization 
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects 
- Convolutional Neural Networks 
- Sequence Models.
